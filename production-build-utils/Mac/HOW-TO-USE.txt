Can you see the oclvanitygen-cash (or vanitygen-cash)
in this directory?

If not, you've downloaded the wrong thing. Please visit
https://github.com/cashaddress/vanitygen-cash/releases
and download from there.

If yes, you're on the correct path to run it! Here are the instructions:

0) Do these instructions for oclvanitygen-cash, it's faster than
   vanitygen-cash. You might need the appropriate `d` argument, like
   `-d 1`, to choose your GPU.

1) Use Spotlight to find and run "Terminal"

2) Type "cd " (with space), then Drag Drop the oclvanitygen-cash to the
   "Command Prompt" window. Remove the last part of the path. Example:
   "cd /Users/blahblah/oclvanitygen-cash" to "cd /Users/blahblah/" Press enter.

3) Run Vanitygen Cash by typing "./oclvanitygen-cash". Press enter.

4) Now it should be showing the arguments! Add the pattern after leaving a
   space ("./oclvanitygen-cash qqsquare")

5) It should be working now! You could also add arguments, like
   "/Users/blahblahpath/oclvanitygen-cash -T qqsquare" for testnet.

Please make sure to keep the Vanitygen Cash executables in this folder, or move `calc_addrs.cl` wherever you move Vanitygen Cash.
