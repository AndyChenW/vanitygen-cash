Can you see the oclVanitygen-cash (or Vanitygen-cash)
in this directory?

If not, you've downloaded the wrong thing. Please visit
https://github.com/cashaddress/vanitygen-cash/releases
and download from there.

If yes, you're on the correct path to run it!

It seems you're trying to run this on Linux. Probably you know
how to use the Terminal and don't need this manual.

If you need help, the steps are the same of Mac steps:
