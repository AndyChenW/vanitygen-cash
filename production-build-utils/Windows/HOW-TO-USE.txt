Can you see the oclVanitygenCash.exe (or VanitygenCash.exe)
in this directory?

If not, you've downloaded the wrong thing. Please visit
https://github.com/cashaddress/vanitygen-cash/releases
and download from there.

If yes, you're on the correct path to run it! Here are the instructions:

1) Press "Windows Button" and "R" at the same time
   "Run" window should open

2) Type "cmd" without quotes and press enter
   "Command Prompt" should open

3) Drag N Drop the oclVanitygenCash to the "Command Prompt" window
   and press enter

4) Now it should be showing the arguments! Press the "up arrow" button
   to recall the command. It should look like
   "C:/blahblah/oclVanitygenCash.exe"

5) Add the pattern after the space (like
   "C:/blahblah/oclVanitygenCash.exe qqsquare")

6) It should be working now! You could also add arguments, like
   "C:/blahblah/oclVanitygenCash.exe -T qqsquare" for testnet.
