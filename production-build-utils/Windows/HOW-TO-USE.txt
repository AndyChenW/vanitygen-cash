Can you see the oclvanitygen-cash.exe (or vanitygen-cash.exe)
in this directory?

If not, you've downloaded the wrong thing. Please visit
https://github.com/cashaddress/vanitygen-cash/releases
and download from there.

If yes, you're on the correct path to run it! Here are the instructions:

0) Do these instructions for oclvanitygen-cash.exe, it's faster than
   vanitygen-cash.exe. You might need the appropriate `d` argument, like
   `-d 1`, to choose your GPU.

1) Press "Windows Button" and "R" at the same time
   "Run" window should open

2) Type "cmd" without quotes and press enter.
   "Command Prompt" should open

3) Type "cd " (with space), then Drag Drop the oclvanitygen-cash to the
   "Command Prompt" window. Remove the last part of the path. Example:
   "cd C:/blahblah/oclvanitygen-cash.exe" to "cd C:/blahblah/" Press enter.

4) Run Vanitygen Cash by typing "oclvanitygen-cash.exe". Press enter.

5) Now it should be showing the arguments! Add the pattern after leaving a
   space ("oclvanitygen-cash.exe qqsquare")

6) It should be working now! You could also add arguments, like
   "C:/blahblah/oclvanitygen-cash.exe -T qqsquare" for testnet.

lease make sure to keep the Vanitygen Cash executables in this folder, or move `calc_addrs.cl` and `.dll` files wherever you move Vanitygen Cash.
